Convert [GTALUG - Toronto Area Linux User Group](https://gtalug.org) calendar to ical

Based on [this](https://gist.github.com/myles/5459397). Thank you very much [Myles](https://gist.github.com/myles).
I just happend to be searching for a python example on how to create ics / icalendar files.
Found this ghist and made it run for me. I added requirements to make it run for a noob like myself.

To run this:
- create virtualenv `$> virtualenv venv --python=python3`
- source virtualenv: `$> source ./venv/bin/activate`
- install requirements `$> pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
- run with `$> python3 ical.py`
